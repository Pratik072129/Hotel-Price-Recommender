# Hotel-Price-Recommender

## Implementation

This project involves building a hotel price recommender system. Below are the steps to implement the feature:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on hotel prices, locations, amenities, and customer reviews.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful features such as location proximity, seasonal trends, and customer preferences.
4. **Model Selection**: Choose a suitable machine learning model (e.g., regression, decision trees, or neural networks) for price prediction.
5. **Training and Evaluation**: Train the model on the dataset and evaluate its performance using metrics like RMSE or MAE.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the model as an API or integrate it into a web application for user interaction.

## Future Scope


1. **Dynamic Pricing**: Incorporate real-time data to enable dynamic pricing based on demand and supply.
2. **Personalization**: Use customer profiles and preferences to recommend personalized hotel options.
3. **Integration with Travel Platforms**: Collaborate with travel platforms to provide seamless booking experiences.
4. **Scalability**: Enhance the system to handle large-scale data and support global hotel listings.
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement advanced analytics for insights into customer behavior and market trends.
